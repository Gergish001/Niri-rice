# Blyat .dotfiles
I made it for myself on my VAIO SVE151 laptop, but now updating it some files for my friend and his Acer laptop, gonna post wallpapers and other things for config

also this .dotfiles are for Niri, newest scrollable wm on wayland (compositor but who cares?)
# packages that i install
   ```bash
   zsh (pacman)
   waypaper (AUR)
   swww (pacman)
   cava (pacman)
   zen-browser (flatpak)
   fastfetch (pacman)
   alacritty (pacman)
   zoxide (pacman)
   some nerd font (pacman)

   ```
# **installing zsh**

   after downloading zsh change shell to zsh by `chsh (your password for sudo); /bin/zsh`

   in home directory place `.zshrc start` dont forget to remowe "start"

   then in terminal type zsh and start configuring by your taste
   
   ater everything change .zshrc на `.zshrc final` read aliases and set them as you want

# for managing my wallpapers i use waypaper with swww

# thats it for now!
